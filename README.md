# scaffold-vercel-edge

scaffold vercel edge starter that doesn't waste your time. The configuration actually makes sense.

Built by [Augustus Rivers](https://offlabel.design) because rebuilding this from scratch every time is tedious.

## What's This?

A scaffold that actually works. Not some half-finished tutorial code,
but production-ready configuration you can deploy. Still needs customization
for your specific use case, but the hard parts are done.

## Running It

Check the project files and customize for your needs. The code has comments
explaining the non-obvious bits.

## Built With

- Best practices from 2025
- Real error handling
- Documentation that doesn't assume you're psychic
- Configuration that works out of the box

## Customization

This is YOUR project now. Change whatever. The whole point of a scaffold
is to give you a foundation, not lock you into specific choices.
